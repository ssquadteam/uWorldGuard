/**
 * The player state uWorldGuard has overridden and still owes back, mirrored to disk so it survives a
 * shutdown that could not undo it — including one that never runs.
 *
 * <p>{@code MovementListener} restores game-mode, speed and flight itself whenever the flag stops
 * applying, and on disable for every player the disabling thread owns. Under regionized threading
 * that is only the region doing the disabling: no API reaches into another region synchronously, and
 * a task scheduled there is never run, because the plugin's tasks are cancelled with it. Without
 * this, a player left standing in a {@code game-mode} region on any other region's thread would have
 * creative written into their playerdata and keep it for good — the plugin is the only thing that
 * knows it did that, so it has to be the thing that remembers.
 *
 * <p>A crash reaches no disable at all, which is why this mirrors the overrides as they are taken
 * rather than only collecting them at the end. The mirror is in memory and the disk write is
 * write-behind: {@link #record} and {@link #forget} publish to memory and ask for a flush, and the
 * flush is one async write {@value #FLUSH_DELAY_SECONDS} second later. Nothing touches the disk on
 * the movement path, which is where those calls come from.
 *
 * <p>Debounced rather than polled, so the delay is the whole crash window instead of the average of
 * a fixed interval, and so a server where no region sets these flags never wakes for this at all —
 * a poll would wake forever to find nothing changed. Coalescing is the other half: a player walking
 * back and forth across a region border cannot turn crossings into writes, because the flush already
 * pending covers them all.
 *
 * <p>The file is read and deleted at enable, replayed as those players log in, and written out again
 * at disable with whatever is still outstanding. Absent file, empty file and unreadable file all mean
 * the same thing: nothing to undo.
